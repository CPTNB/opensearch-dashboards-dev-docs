## CapabilitiesSetup interface

APIs to manage the [Capabilities](./opensearch-dashboards.capabilities.md) that will be used by the application.

Plugins relying on capabilities to toggle some of their features should register them during the setup phase using the `registerProvider` method.

Plugins having the responsibility to restrict capabilities depending on a given context should register their capabilities switcher using the `registerSwitcher` method.

Refers to the methods documentation for complete description and examples.
