## OpenSearchConfig class

Wrapper of config schema.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class OpenSearchConfig 
```

## Constructors

|  Constructor | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [(constructor)(rawConfig)](./opensearch-dashboards.opensearchconfig._constructor_.md) |  | Constructs a new instance of the <code>OpenSearchConfig</code> class |

## Properties

|  Property | Modifiers | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  [apiVersion](./opensearch-dashboards.opensearchconfig.apiversion.md) |  | string | Version of the OpenSearch (1.1, 2.1 or <code>main</code>) client will be connecting to. |
|  [customHeaders](./opensearch-dashboards.opensearchconfig.customheaders.md) |  | OpenSearchConfigType\['customHeaders'\] | Header names and values to send to OpenSearch with every request. These headers cannot be overwritten by client-side headers and aren't affected by <code>requestHeadersWhitelist</code> configuration. |
|  [healthCheckDelay](./opensearch-dashboards.opensearchconfig.healthcheckdelay.md) |  | Duration | The interval between health check requests OpenSearch Dashboards sends to the OpenSearch. |
|  [hosts](./opensearch-dashboards.opensearchconfig.hosts.md) |  | string\[\] | Hosts that the client will connect to. If sniffing is enabled, this list will be used as seeds to discover the rest of your cluster. |
|  [ignoreVersionMismatch](./opensearch-dashboards.opensearchconfig.ignoreversionmismatch.md) |  | boolean | Whether to allow opensearch-dashboards to connect to a non-compatible opensearch node. |
|  [logQueries](./opensearch-dashboards.opensearchconfig.logqueries.md) |  | boolean | Specifies whether all queries to the client should be logged (status code, method, query etc.). |
|  [memoryCircuitBreaker](./opensearch-dashboards.opensearchconfig.memorycircuitbreaker.md) |  | OpenSearchConfigType\['memoryCircuitBreaker'\] | Set of options to configure memory circuit breaker for query response. The <code>maxPercentage</code> field is to determine the threshold for maximum heap size for memory circuit breaker. By default the value is <code>1.0</code>. The <code>enabled</code> field specifies whether the client should protect large response that can't fit into memory. |
|  [optimizedHealthcheckId?](./opensearch-dashboards.opensearchconfig.optimizedhealthcheckid.md) |  | string | <i>(Optional)</i> Specifies whether Dashboards should only query the local OpenSearch node when all nodes in the cluster have the same node attribute value |
|  [password?](./opensearch-dashboards.opensearchconfig.password.md) |  | string | <i>(Optional)</i> If OpenSearch is protected with basic authentication, this setting provides the password that the OpenSearch Dashboards server uses to perform its administrative functions. |
|  [pingTimeout](./opensearch-dashboards.opensearchconfig.pingtimeout.md) |  | Duration | Timeout after which PING HTTP request will be aborted and retried. |
|  [requestHeadersWhitelist](./opensearch-dashboards.opensearchconfig.requestheaderswhitelist.md) |  | string\[\] | List of OpenSearch Dashboards client-side headers to send to OpenSearch when request scoped cluster client is used. If this is an empty array then \*no\* client-side will be sent. |
|  [requestTimeout](./opensearch-dashboards.opensearchconfig.requesttimeout.md) |  | Duration | Timeout after which HTTP request will be aborted and retried. |
|  [shardTimeout](./opensearch-dashboards.opensearchconfig.shardtimeout.md) |  | Duration | Timeout for OpenSearch to wait for responses from shards. Set to 0 to disable. |
|  [sniffInterval](./opensearch-dashboards.opensearchconfig.sniffinterval.md) |  | false \| Duration | Interval to perform a sniff operation and make sure the list of nodes is complete. If <code>false</code> then sniffing is disabled. |
|  [sniffOnConnectionFault](./opensearch-dashboards.opensearchconfig.sniffonconnectionfault.md) |  | boolean | Specifies whether the client should immediately sniff for a more current list of nodes when a connection dies. |
|  [sniffOnStart](./opensearch-dashboards.opensearchconfig.sniffonstart.md) |  | boolean | Specifies whether the client should attempt to detect the rest of the cluster when it is first instantiated. |
|  [ssl](./opensearch-dashboards.opensearchconfig.ssl.md) |  | Pick&lt;SslConfigSchema, Exclude&lt;keyof SslConfigSchema, 'certificateAuthorities' \| 'keystore' \| 'truststore'&gt;&gt; &amp; { certificateAuthorities?: string\[\]; } | Set of settings configure SSL connection between OpenSearch Dashboards and OpenSearch that are required when <code>xpack.ssl.verification_mode</code> in OpenSearch is set to either <code>certificate</code> or <code>full</code>. |
|  [username?](./opensearch-dashboards.opensearchconfig.username.md) |  | string | <i>(Optional)</i> If OpenSearch is protected with basic authentication, this setting provides the username that the OpenSearch Dashboards server uses to perform its administrative functions. |
