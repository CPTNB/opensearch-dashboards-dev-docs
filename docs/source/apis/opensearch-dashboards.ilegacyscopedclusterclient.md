Serves the same purpose as "normal" `ClusterClient` but exposes additional `callAsCurrentUser` method that doesn't use credentials of the OpenSearch Dashboards internal user (as `callAsInternalUser` does) to request OpenSearch API, but rather passes HTTP headers extracted from the current user request to the API.
