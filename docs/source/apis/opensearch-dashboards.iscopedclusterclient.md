## IScopedClusterClient interface

Serves the same purpose as the normal [cluster client](./opensearch-dashboards.iclusterclient.md) but exposes an additional `asCurrentUser` method that doesn't use credentials of the OpenSearch Dashboards internal user (as `asInternalUser` does) to request OpenSearch API, but rather passes HTTP headers extracted from the current user request to the API instead.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export interface IScopedClusterClient 
```
